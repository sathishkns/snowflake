	-cloud data platform
	-ELT 
	-ELT tools - fivetran,stitch
	-snowflake will not have connector/drivers to pull data
	-we should have custom code like py application, jdbc driver, csv data to push data to snow flake
	

# snowflake session 2 (08/06)
	-basically snowflake is a service(running on top of cloud platform), and we have many clients like webUI, CLI, python, Dbeaver
	-CLI is called snowSQL (installed in local machine)
	-those commands from client will get executed in VPC
	
	- how many hours and how much stored is pricing storage cost
	- Micropartition
	- warehouse object
	- Data Sharing
	
# session 3 - took from mobile

	-privileges - what level of operation perform

# sesson 4 -
	Account is top level object (my account)
		useradmin (default role)
		sysadmin (default role)
		securityadmin (default role)
		
		# users and roles		
		
		sales roles (user defined role)
			sales user
		HR role (user defined role)
			HR user
		finance role (user defined role)
			finance user
			
			all three reporting to SYSADMIN
			
		create seperate warehouse
			sales warehouse
			HR warehouse
			finance warehouse
			
		create database
			sales schema
			HR schema
			finance schema

Snowflake Advantages:

	Snowpipe
	Secure Data Sharing
	Time Travel
	Low maintenance from infrastructure side
	Easy administration
	Incredibly flexible for an RDBMS
	Dynamic Data Masking
	Zero Copy Clone for Sandbox Env Creation.
	Undrop for accidents and Swap for data swapping
	no duplicate load from external stage if we run load (copy command) multiple times (it does signature check)
	profiling features in the Snowsight UI
	Auto suspend of compute at 5 min of inactivity (vs Databricks at 10).
	Faster start time of cluster/compute. You can go from 0 to millions of rows in a few secs, while Databricks you would have to wait to boot up.
	Cloning
	Ability to use either INTERNAL or EXTERNAL stage
	Data sharing
	Extremely simplified data replication for DR
	Time Travel, which makes backup jobs redundant
	3x HA, generally unusual for data warehouses
	Connection URL for PROD & DR, which means you donâ€™t have to change a thing in the app for DR switch
	Snowpark
